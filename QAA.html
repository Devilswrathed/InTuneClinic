            <button type="button" class="collapsible">What is the purpose of a Deep Tissue Massage?</button>
            <div class="content">

                <h2>Deep Tissue Overview</h2>

                <h3>A deep tissue massage is designed to target the deeper layers of muscles and connective tissue in the body. Its primary purposes include:</h3>

                <br>

                <h3>Relieving Chronic Pain:</h3>

                    <p>
                        By breaking down adhesions and scar tissue, deep tissue massage can alleviate chronic pain in areas such as the back, neck, and shoulders.
                    </p>

                <br>

                <h3>Reducing Muscle Tension:</h3>

                    <p>
                        It helps release muscle tightness and tension, improving flexibility and range of motion.
                    </p>

                <br>

                <h3>Enhancing Blood Flow:</h3>

                    <p>
                        The techniques used in deep tissue massage promote better circulation, which aids in faster healing and recovery.
                    </p>

                <br>

                <h3>Decreasing Inflammation:</h3>

                    <p>
                        It helps reduce inflammation and muscle soreness, making it beneficial for those recovering from injuries or intense physical activity.
                    </p>

                <br>

                <h3>Promoting Relaxation:</h3>

                    <p>
                        Despite its intensity, deep tissue massage can also help reduce stress and promote relaxation by triggering the bodyâ€™s natural relaxation response.
